# BRAVE-project

**The BRAVE Project** is our thesis project. It combines **virtual reality (VR)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** to support phobia treatment. The project is divided into two main parts:  

- **Virtual Reality (VR):** Development of immersive environments designed to expose users to their phobias.  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Creation of a system with two components:  
  1. **Emotion state classification** of the patient (developed by a research team).  
  2. **Imitation Learning System**, capable of adjusting VR parameters based on the actions of an expert psychologist.  

The goal is to create an integrated system that dynamically adapts the VR experience based on user reactions, enhancing the effectiveness of the treatment.
